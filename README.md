## Hi there 👋
Hey 😃 I'm Nir, an undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. Here's some more about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a SWE intern at **Firebolt Inc** and developing my personal **Micro Prop Shop** project--a high-frequency multi-container trading service that ingests/replays ticker data, uses an LSTM model I trained for inference, and serves trading signals in <20 ms! 
- 📚 I'm currently reading Probabilistic Machine Learning by Kevin Murphy and Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann. I would love to check out any of your own recommendations!
- 📫 Reach me at npechuk@gmail.com
